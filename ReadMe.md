This directory includes an .apk file to install the app on any android device. The default behaviour on android, though, is to not allow third party apps. To disable this feature, do the following:

- Go to Settings -> Security
- Under Phone Administration, check the box that says "Unknown Source"

For further changes and experimentation to the project, here are some suggested changes to `Fractal.java`:

- Change the max number of iterations in the main for loop 
- Change the formula for color
- Implement emulated double precision
